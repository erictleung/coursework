# Installation

Installing `scala` was way less painful than I had imagined (at least for
downloading it on a Mac). All I had to do was go to the `scala` [download
page][download], download the .tgz file, unzip it, and (move the folder to my
`Applications` directory so I could then) add the correct paths according to
their [website][install].

From there, if your path is set up correctly, you can just call the Scala
interpreter by launching `scala`. The Scala compiler is launched with `scalac`.
