# Exercise 2: Make is Your Python Now

## About Make

In Python, you could run a script by running: `python your_script.py`.
Similarly, the `make` command does the hard compiling for you.

According to the [GNU `make` documentation][makedocs], the `make` utility
"determines automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them."

## Using Make

Say we have a program `ex1.c` and we want to compile it. Using `make`, we can
type the following in our command line: `make ex1`. 

This will set in motion the following process in your computer:

- Does the file `ex1` exist?
- No. Okay, is there another file that exists as `ex1`?
- Yes, but it's called `ex1.c`. Do I know how to build `.c` files?
- Yes, I can run the command `cc ex1.c -o ex1` to build it.
- I shall make you one `ex1` by using `cc` to build it from `ex1.c`

A way to pass some modifiers to `make` is to prepend them to your command:
`CFLAG="-Wall" make ex1`.

A note about makefiles is that they should be tab indented instead of a mixture
of spaces and tabs. 

## What can we do now?

A simple make file could be:

```
CFLAGS=-Wall -g

clean:
    rm -f ex1
``

This allows you to build your program with `make ex1` and remove your compiled
program with `make clean`. 

## Make Rules and Targets

In our example, the `clean` is what is called a *target*. Targets are the name
of a file that is generated by a program. However, in our example, `clean` is
the name of an action to take, so these are called *phony targets*. 

In the rare case you have a file called `clean`, using `make clean` will
actually not do anything because `make` realizes `clean` already exists so there
is no need to do anything. To alleviate thie, you explicitly declare the target
to be "phony."

```
.PHONY: clean
clean:
    rm *.o temp
```

## Compiling with just `make`

You can also compile all your programs with just the `all` target.

```
all: prog1 prog2 prog3
```

The `make` command will remake the targets at the very beginning by default. So
if you have a `clean` target before the `all`, using `make` by itself will just
clean and remove your files instead of building them.
