# Exercise 8: Sizes and Arrays

## Sizeof() Function

Here, the `sizeof` function is introduced. It returns back the size of the
variable that is given as an argument.

According to [Wikipedia][wiki-sizeof], `sizeof` is a "unary operator that
generates the size of any variable or datatype, measured in the number of
*char* size units required to represent the type."

## Unary Operators

Another word I didn't understand was "unary operator." Once again, according to
[Wikipedia][unary], a unary operation is "an operation with only one operand,
i.e. a single input." So this concept is pretty easy to understand. Just a
command with one argument or parameter in order to produce its output.

## Some Integer Datatypes

With the `printf()` function, it'll print formatted text. One new type to print
is the `%ld`, which stands for "long numbers," which are capable of storing
larger numbers.

With regular signed integers, it has a range of [-32,767 -- +32,767]. Meanwhile, a
long integer has a larger range of [-2,147,483,647 -- +2,147,483,647].
