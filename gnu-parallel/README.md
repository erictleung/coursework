# GNU parallel

I've decided to learn GNU `parallel` because of a [Biostars][post] post I read
by the creator, Ole Tange. 

My "coursework" will comprise of his scripts he has written in said post, but
also of the scripts found in the [tutorial][tutorial] site.

More information about GNU `parallel` can be found [here][website].
