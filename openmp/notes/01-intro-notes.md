# Introduction

One of the most commonly used parallel programming language in use today. And it
is relatively easy to use. Becauase you do not get busy with learning the syntax
but you can just get into parallel programming.

## Assumptions

- C programming skills (also supports Fortran and C++)
- Brand new to parallel programming
- You have access to compiler that supports OpenMP

## Preliminaries

- Active learning is expected.
- Do exercises! Even though some are designed for you to fail.

## Overview

1. Getting Started with OpenMP
2. The Core Features of OpenMP
3. Working with OpenMP
4. Advanced OpenMP Topics
5. Recapitulation/Conclusion
