# Introduction to Parallel Programming Part 2

## Concurrency vs Parallelism

- Concurrency: things are active at the same time
- Parallelism: things are running and doing things are the same time

This is a subtle difference between the two. To use an analogy of constructing a
house, concurrency is having five people working on a house together but only
one person is working on the house at one time. Parallelism of building a
house means that everyone is working on the house simultaneously.
